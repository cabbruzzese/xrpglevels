Similar to the Lost Soul, the Lost Spirit will charge at its target, but the duration of the attack
is limited to about 1.5 seconds. When closer to the target, it shoots two projectiles with a limited
range. The Lost Spirit deals more damage and has more health than the Lost Soul. It is a ghost, so
it feels no pain and it can fly through anything (only collides with other actors during the charge
attack).
